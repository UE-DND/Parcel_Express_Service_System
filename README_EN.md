# Object-Oriented Programming Course Project - Parcel Express Service System

English | [中文](README.md)

## Project Overview
This project requires designing a parcel express service system to simulate the parcel delivery service of courier companies like FedEx, DHL, and UPS. The system uses an object-oriented inheritance hierarchy to represent different types of packages and their postage calculation rules.

## System Requirements

### Inheritance Hierarchy
- **Package**: As the base class, representing ordinary parcels
- **TwoDayPackage**: A subclass of Package, representing two-day delivery parcels
- **OvernightPackage**: A subclass of Package, representing overnight/next morning delivery parcels

### Class Design Requirements

#### Package Class (Ordinary Parcel)
1. Member Variables:
   - Sender information (name, address, city, state/province, zip code, phone)
   - Recipient information (name, address, city, state/province, zip code, phone)
   - Package weight (unit: ounces)
   - Constant: Basic shipping cost per ounce (COST_PER_OUNCE) is $1.16
   - **Static variable**: Variable (numberOfShippingOrder) to record the total number of orders for the courier company, automatically incremented each time a package object is created

2. Constructor:
   - Initialize basic attributes of the package, package weight must be positive
   - **Error handling**: If the weight passed in is not positive, an exception should be thrown or an error prompt should be given

3. Regular Methods:
   - Accessors and modifiers for sender and recipient attributes
   - Accessor and modifier for package weight (verify if it's positive when setting weight)
   - getCostPerOunce: Get the basic shipping cost per ounce
   - calculateCost: Calculate the total shipping cost of the package
     - **Calculation formula**: `totalCost = weight × COST_PER_OUNCE`

#### TwoDayPackage Class (Two-Day Delivery Parcel)
1. Additional Member Variables:
   - flatFee: Additional flat fee

2. Constructor:
   - Initialize basic package attributes and additional flat fee, weight and flat fee must be positive
   - **Error handling**: If the flat fee is not positive, an exception should be thrown or an error prompt should be given

3. Overridden Methods:
   - calculateCost: Add additional flat fee on top of the ordinary package postage
     - **Calculation formula**: `totalCost = weight × COST_PER_OUNCE + flatFee`

#### OvernightPackage Class (Overnight Delivery Parcel)
1. Additional Member Variables:
   - overnightFeePerOunce: Additional fee per ounce

2. Constructor:
   - Initialize basic package attributes and additional fee per ounce, weight and additional fee per ounce must be positive
   - **Error handling**: If the additional fee per ounce is not positive, an exception should be thrown or an error prompt should be given

3. Overridden Methods:
   - calculateCost: Calculate total shipping cost as weight × (basic shipping cost + additional fee per ounce)
     - **Calculation formula**: `totalCost = weight × (COST_PER_OUNCE + overnightFeePerOunce)`

#### TestParcelPost Class (Test Class)
1. main method: Test creation of different types of packages
2. printShippingOrderInfo method: Print shipping order information, including:
   - Order type
   - Sender and recipient information
   - Package weight
   - Total postage of the package (accurate to 2 decimal places)
   - **Output format**:
     ```
     =======================================
     [••• PARCEL TYPE •••] Parcel Type Name
     
     From: Sender Name
     #Sender Address, Sender City, Sender State/Province
     Tel:(Sender Phone)  ZIP:(Sender Zip Code)
     ---------------------------------------
     To: Recipient Name
     #Recipient Address, Recipient City, Recipient State/Province
     Tel:(Recipient Phone)  ZIP:(Recipient Zip Code)
     
     WEIGHT: Weight Value ounce
     PAYMENT: $ Cost Value (with 2 decimal places)
     =======================================
     ```
3. Finally display the total number of shipping orders generated by the courier company
   - Display format: `The courier company has generated XX shipping orders.` (where XX is the value of the static variable numberOfShippingOrder)

## Test Cases

### Package 1: Ordinary Package
```java
Package package1 = new Package("LeBron James", "#23 Main St", "Cleveland", 
"Ohio", 11111, "(+86)139-1111-1111", "Dirk Nowitzki", "#41 Waterview Pkwy", 
"Dallas", "Texas", 22222, "(+86)139-2222-2222", 3.02);
```

### Package 2: Two-Day Package
```java
TwoDayPackage package2 = new TwoDayPackage("Kobe Bryant", "#24 Broadway", 
"Los Angeles", "California", 33333, "(+86)139-3333-3333", "Michael Jordan", 
"#23 King Rd", "Chicago", "Illinois", 44444, "(+86)139-4444-4444", 12.28, 5.5);
```

### Package 3: Overnight Package
```java
OvernightPackage package3 = new OvernightPackage("James Harden", "#13 Oak St", 
"Houston", "Texas", 55555, "(+86)139-5555-5555", "Stephen Curry", 
"#30 Cambridge Rd", "San Francisco", "California", 66666, "(+86)139-6666-6666", 
11.24, 0.75);
```
